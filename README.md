# UI

This is the readme doc. I created two .html docs 1 for the home page labeled indes.html and the 2nd for the about labeled about.html. There is only one css page labeled index.css for both html pages and all styling will be done on that. I added team member images for the about page, and I added small images for the nav bar for each link.From the home page the only link that is usable is the about link and on the about page the only link that is usable is the home link.
